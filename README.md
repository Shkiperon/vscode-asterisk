Syntax highlighting for Asterisk dialplan.

## Features

Highlighting scopes include applications, functions, expressions, extension patterns, priority labels.

Insert a new extension snippet with default values by typing 'e' and then pressing 'TAB'. Tab stops at extension pattern, priority, application and application data.

## Known Issues

Not tested with newer Asterisk syntax > v1.8

Some highlighting scopes are not semantically correct. The included color themes don't support many scopes so trade-offs were made to ensure highlighting of key features.

## Release Notes
